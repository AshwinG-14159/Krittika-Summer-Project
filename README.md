# Krittika-Summer-Project

Krittika Summer Project was my first step towards actual astrophysics data analysis. For the first time, I read published
scientific papers with the intent to understand and implement the techniques described in them. The Project went by in a very 
structured fashion as well where I was able to learn to collaborate with people on github and write modular code.
